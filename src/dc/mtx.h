/* mtx.h -- the port's 4x4 float matrix ops, behind one switch.
 *
 * Row-major storage, column-vector semantics: out = A * v, translation in
 * m[3], m[7], m[11]. This is the transpose of what the game's sys/matrix.c
 * writes, so matrices compose the usual way round (parent * local); the
 * game's matrix row/column layout is the reference.
 *
 * MTX_BACKEND picks the implementation, and the game's build makes SH4ZAM
 * the default (src/game/ssb64/Makefile): the same algebra on the SH4's FPU
 * back-bank, and measured in a soak the faster of the two by a wide margin.
 * MTX_BACKEND_SCALAR is the plain C these bodies were lifted from; both
 * stay in the tree so a regression can be bisected against the scalar path
 * on the target, and `make MTX_BACKEND=SCALAR` is how a build asks for it.
 * The #ifndef below still falls back to SCALAR, so anything that does not
 * set the macro -- the host cross-tests, off-target -- gets the plain C
 * without having to know any of this.
 *
 * SH4ZAM stores column-major, so on our row-major arrays load_4x4(A) puts
 * A-transpose in XMTRX and load/apply/store reverses the operands. The two
 * idioms that follow differ, and mixing them up still renders something:
 *
 *   matmul to memory   raw loads, operands swapped   (no transpose ops)
 *   matrix to FTRV     transpose an odd number of times
 *
 * scripts/test_host.sh checks that algebra both ways round. It cannot check
 * accuracy: on the host SH4ZAM falls back to exact libm, so FSCA and FSRRA
 * divergence is invisible there and needs an on-target A/B run.
