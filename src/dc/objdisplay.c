/* objdisplay.c -- the port's replacement for sys/objdisplay.c.
 *
 * objdisplay.c is the one file of the object system that does not come
 * across. Its 3394 lines are the GBI emitter: it walks the camera list
 * and the DObj trees, composes the matrix stack, and writes F3DEX2
 * commands into the task manager's display-list buffers. The walk is the
 * game's and the port keeps it -- function for function, in the same
 * order, off the same fields; the emission is the RDP's and the port
 * replaces it with PVR submission.
 *
 * So this is a rewrite behind a ported interface, like taskman.c: scene
 * code and the rest of the object system go on calling the names
 * sys/objdisplay.h declares -- which is why there is no header here, only
 * the decomp's and the port's own objpvr.h -- and what happens underneath
 * is the Dreamcast's. Each function below says which line of
 * objdisplay.c it stands in for.
 *
 * Three divergences run through the whole file and are not repeated at
 * every site:
 *
 * 1. THE MATRIX STACK IS OURS. The RSP holds a ten-deep modelview stack
 *    and gSPMatrix pushes, multiplies and loads into it; there is no RSP
 *    here, so the stack is the array below and gcPrepDObjMatrix drives it
 *    directly. It is deliberately ten deep, F3DEX2's G_MTX_STACKSIZE: a
 *    DObj tree that overflows it would have overflowed the N64's too, so
 *    this is the game's own limit and not a new one.
 *
 * 2. THREE PASSES, NOT FOUR BUFFERS. The N64 fills four display-list
 *    buffers in one walk -- opaque into 0 and 2, translucent into 1 and 3
 *    (func_8001663C picks the render mode from the buffer id) -- and the
 *    RSP runs them in order afterwards. The PVR cannot interleave its
 *    lists: a list is opened, filled and closed. So the walk itself runs
 *    once per list -- PVR_LIST_OP_POLY, then PVR_LIST_PT_POLY, then
 *    PVR_LIST_TR_POLY -- and a DObj's payload submits only the geometry
 *    belonging to the list that is open (gcGetDrawList). Everything the
 *    camera_mask/DL-link machinery decides -- which lists a camera draws,
 *    in which order -- is untouched; only the number of walks changes.
 *
 *    The buffer id is not what picks the list here. The four heads only
 *    ever say opaque or translucent, which cannot express the RDP's third
 *    case -- the alpha-tested cutout a stage's foliage is drawn with,
 *    G_RM_AA_ZB_TEX_EDGE -- and a stage whose layer_mask is 0 never
 *    reaches a second head at all. So the exporter reads the render mode
 *    itself and the batch carries the answer (fighter.h FPACK_LIST_*),
 *    with punch-through standing in for the cutout.
 *
 * 3. NO MATRIX CACHING. XObj.unk05 and gSYTaskmanGraphicsHeap between
 *    them decide, in about 150 lines of gcPrepDObjMatrix, whether a
 *    DObj's Mtx is recomputed this frame or reused from the XObj because
 *    the RSP still has last frame's copy. That is a DMA-and-double-buffer
 *    optimisation for a coprocessor reading memory the CPU is writing.
 *    Nothing here is read by anyone else, so every matrix is composed
 *    fresh and those lines are gone.

 * row 1 becomes -P[0]*sin + P[1]*cos, row 2 stays P[2]. So the DObj's

 * sys/objman.c's gcAddXObjForDObjVar is where the question comes from: an
 * XObj of a vector kind does not merely sit in `dobj->xobjs[]`, it claims
 * the vectors it writes -- `*translate = dGCTranslateDefault;
 * translate->xobj = xobj;` -- so GCTranslate/GCRotate/GCScale each name
 * the one XObj that currently owns them. gcAddXObjForDObjFixed APPENDS
 * (it is gcAddXObjForDObjVar at index `xobjs_num`), so adding, say, a
 * TraRotRpyR to a DObj that already had the Tra/RotRpyR/Sca triple leaves
 * the first two in the array with nothing left to drive.
 *
 * The decomp's own walk does not ask, because on the N64 it never has to:
 * a DObj there is given its transform set ONCE. This port diverges at
 * exactly the place where it matters -- dc_model_add_dobjs gives every
 * joint the three-XObj set (gcAddDObjMatrixSetsRpyR) where a decomp item
 * root is given the single fused kind its ITDesc names (see
 * src/dc/itemmodel.c's own note) -- and then ten verbatim it/ makers
 * append their own fused kind on top of it: itmsbomb.c, itmball.c,
 * itiwark.c, itnyars.c, itbox.c, itgshell.c, itrshell.c, itdogas.c,
 * itlizardon.c, ittosakinto.c. Without this check both sets apply and
 * the item composes its translation and rotation TWICE.
 *
 * "Drives" is any of the vectors its kind writes, not all of them: the
 * kinds hand their vectors over as a unit, so an XObj that owns one of
 * its own owns the rest, and the one shape that could split them (a bare
 * Tra appended over a fused kind, taking the translate and leaving the
 * rotation) is not a thing the game does. A kind that writes no DObj
 * vector -- the billboards, the whole-matrix func-list kinds -- is never

 * it. Most of it is the N64's: which tile to load, from where, at what
 * size, through which TLUT. All of that is compiled into the pack at
 * build time here -- one pvr_poly_hdr_t per batch, written by
 * tools/export/ssb_packexport.py -- and only the part of it that a MatAnimJoint
 * can *change* while the scene runs has to happen per frame.
 *
 * That part is the colours: objdisplay.c:1206-1220's gDPSetPrimColor and
 * two gSPLightColor, each emitted only when the MObj's flags ask for it.
 * So this hands the chain to the payload, which knows what to do with it
 * (DCDisplay.proc_material, objpvr.h), and the model folds them over its
 * baked ones as it draws.
 *
 * That part is also the picture: an MObj with a
 * sprite array is one whose MatAnimJoint chooses a texture per frame,
 * and objanim.c's parser leaves the choice in texture_id_curr, which the
 * payload reads out with the colours. src/dc/fighter.c has one compiled
 * poly header per frame waiting for it.
 *
 * DIVERGES: an MObj that steps palette_id is handled where the exporter
 * bakes it (the dynamic palette upload); what is still
 * not here is an MObj that moves or scales the tile, and, in the emblem
 * and How to Play exporters, one that selects a palette or a texture.
 * Those exporters refuse a model whose MObjSub sets those flags, so that
 * much remains a gap checked at build time rather than one that shows on

/* objdisplay.c:2671-2677, the one clear the port keeps: a camera with
 * COBJ_FLAG_FILLCOLOR fills its clamped viewport with its colour before
 * anything it walks is drawn. On the RDP that overwrites whatever the
 * cameras before it drew and lies under whatever comes after, which is
 * what a quad at the frame's next sprite depth does in the translucent
 * list (lbCommonSpriteFillRect), so it is drawn there and in no other
 * pass. The title's fire camera is the colour behind the flames and its
 * proceed camera the three black frames before mode select
 * (mn/mncommon/mntitle.c:1393, :492). Every other scene's clear camera is
 * dropped for the PVR's own clear, so nothing else asks for this; a 3D
 * camera after a fill would draw under it, because the opaque list's
 * depths are all behind the sprite depths. The fill mode takes no
 * alpha, so neither does the quad.
 *
 * The staff roll
 * made a default camera with COBJ_FLAG_FILLCOLOR and then rendered
 * nothing at all, because this quad covered both of its 3D cameras.
 * The fix is to drop the flag and keep the GObj and the colour, which
 * is what six other ported scenes already do.
 *
 * Worth knowing because the failure is indistinguishable from "nothing
 * was submitted": every instrument reads healthy -- packs resident,
 * fighter_draw_tr returning real triangle counts, no assert, no DL
 * overflow -- since the geometry is drawn and then painted over. Build
 * with -DDB_PVR_BUDGET to tell the two apart: real triangle totals with
 * a black screen mean something is covering them; `tris op 0 pt 0 tr 0`
 * means nothing reached the TA and the fault is upstream.
 *
 * DIVERGES: a camera with an empty camera_mask (Room, Standoff and
 * Clash's own gcMakeDefaultCameraGObj, kept for its Z clear)
 * walks no DL links and draws nothing on the N64
 * either -- objhelper.c never gives it a viewport of its own, so
 * cobj->viewport is still whatever gcAddCameraForGObj default-built,
 * the full frame. That is fine on the N64: an empty camera paints no
 * pixels, so it has nothing to protect. Here it still ran through this
 * function every OP pass and unconditionally expanded
 * sGCViewportUnion to that full-frame default -- at dl_link_priority
 * 100, before any of the scene's own 10-310x10-230 cameras, so the
 * union stayed the whole screen for the rest of the frame regardless
 * of how narrow every real camera's own viewport was. The border
 * (syTaskmanDrawBorder) then had nothing left outside the union to
 * blacken, in every scene built this way. The union is a port
 * invention (the N64 has no such union), so it must track only
 * cameras that can put a pixel on screen. */

 * to the PVR list that head's render mode implies. So what is left of
