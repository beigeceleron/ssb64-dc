/* sndres.h -- which samples are in sound RAM, scene by scene.
 *
 * DIVERGES: on the N64 both sample banks are resident for the life of
 * the cartridge -- B1_sounds2's 322 sound effects for the FGM engine and
 * B1_sounds1's 117 instrument waves for the sequencer. The Dreamcast has
 * 2 MB of AICA sound RAM for both, and the VS game alone reaches about
 * 1.97 MB of sound effects and 0.89 MB of music as ADPCM. So the port
 * keeps a scene's samples instead: tools/export/ssb_sndsets.py measures, out of
 * the decomp and the ROM, which samples each group of game code can
 * reach (sndsets.bin), and sndres_enter_scene composes the next scene's
 * need out of those groups and uploads it -- only when it is not already
 * resident, so the menus, and the character select and the stage select,
 * share one upload. The same tool fails the build if any scene's worst
 * case (the four most expensive fighters on the most expensive stage)
 * does not fit.
 *
 * What plays does not change, with one exception at the seams: a swap
 * stops every sound and the music the moment the next scene starts, so
 * a cue still ringing out of the scene before (the stage select's
 * confirm, say) is cut where on the N64 it would finish over the load.
 * Only the swaps do this -- menu to menu, and the character select to
 * the stage select and back, share a set and never swap. A sample a
 * scene can reach and the census did not find is silent, as an unstaged
 * one always was, and logged by the engine that asked for it (fgm.c,
 * aica/seqsyn.c), once per swap.
