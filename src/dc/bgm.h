/* bgm.h -- the port's BGM player: sys/audio.h:202-215 over the AICA,
 * running the game's own compressed-MIDI sequences against the game's
 * own instrument bank. Game code reaches these through the names it
 * already uses, so mpCollisionSetPlayBGM (mp/mpcollision.c:4013-4020)
 * starts a stage's music with nothing in between translating.
 *
 * This file is sys/audio.c's BGM half: the settings, the sequence
 * players' state machine out of syAudioThreadMain (sys/audio.c:1096-1160)
 * and the six entry points below. The sequencer itself is
 * src/dc/seq/seqcore.c, run in the AICA firmware (bgmarm.h), over the
 * bank bgmbank.h.
 *
 * Tracks are named by the game's own gmMusicID (gm/gmsound.h:30-81),
 * which is the index into S1_music.sbk's sequence array and therefore
 * the index into the pack.
 *
 * DIVERGES: the N64 runs this on its audio thread, woken by the
 * scheduler once a video frame, and renders the whole mix on the RSP.
 * Here a KOS thread ticks the sequencer about every millisecond and the
 * AICA renders; a video frame is too coarse a clock for a sequencer
 * whose ticks are a few milliseconds apart. The scheduler is put on a
 * 1 kHz quantum for it (thd_set_hz), which is what makes a 1 ms sleep
 * mean 1 ms.
