/* The game's FGM sound-effect engine, on AICA channels.
 *
 * A sound effect is three layers of bytecode, not a sample: fgm.ucd[id] is
 * the voice script (articulation select, volume/pan, packed note rows),
 * each note runs fgm.tbl[n] per frame (envelope ramps, `trigger` = start a
 * B1_sounds2 bank sound), and notes carry fgm.unk LFOs (vibrato, sweeps,
 * randomised shapes). This is a port of the three interpreters in
 * src/libultra/n_audio/n_env.c (func_80026B90 / func_80027460 /
 * func_800293A8), command for command, over AICA channels instead of the
 * RSP synthesizer.
 *
 * The pitch rule learned from the original: n_alSynStartVoiceParams takes
 * alCents2Ratio(cents) with no sample-rate factor, so 0 cents plays a
 * sample at the synthesizer's *output* rate -- the game runs
 * osAiSetFrequency(32000) -- regardless of the bank's 44.1 kHz tag. Hence
 * FGM_BASE_RATE below, not the pack's per-sound rate.
 *
 * The FGM files stay big-endian (be.h) like all logic data; the samples
 * come from tools/export/ssb_fgmexport.py as Yamaha ADPCM (AICA_SM_ADPCM),
 * which the AICA decodes in hardware -- 4 bits a sample against the 2 MB of
 * sound RAM the music bank already half fills.

 * says when it wants to be called again: func_800293A8 returns
 * D_8009EDD0_406D0.unk_alsound_0x44, set at n_env.c:5339 to

 * that back into samples with _n_timeToSamplesNoRound (n_env.c:2329,

 * is 184 samples of output whatever it is -- 5750 us at the 32000 Hz
 * sys/audio.c:95 asks osAiSetFrequency for. That is 174 Hz.
