"""What each machine's FPU is allowed to do, on both sides of the port.

The SH-4 has a fused multiply-accumulate, `fmac`, which computes a*b + c
with **one** rounding. The VR4300 has no such instruction: the decomp
builds with `-mips2` (ssb-decomp-re/Makefile:94), and a fused
multiply-add first appears in MIPS IV. So wherever GCC contracts the
game's own arithmetic into an `fmac` -- which its default
`-ffp-contract=fast` does, silently, with nothing in this repository
saying so -- the port computes a number the N64 could not have computed.

Two legs, one subject:

  rom      every code range smashbrothers.us.yaml names, scanned for a
           fused multiply-add encoding. This is the claim "the N64 never
           did this" made against the ROM's own bytes rather than
           against the ISA manual.

  objects  the built Dreamcast objects, scanned for `fmac` (and, for
           scripts/test_purity.sh, for `fsca` and `fsrra`), with the
           SH-4's constant pools excluded -- see pool_addresses below,
           because they are the reason a naive grep is wrong.

Usage:
  python3 tools/check/fpu_check.py                       # the rom leg
  python3 tools/check/fpu_check.py --objects a.o b.o ... # the object leg

    ft/ftparam.c's ftParamMakeEffect has a 92-entry table followed by
    four hundred bytes of the function's own head before the first case,
    and reading into that lands on a `nop`, whose halfword is a
    displacement of 9 and collapses the bound to the table's second byte.
    Fifty of the table's default entries then read as `fmac`.

    Only the `mov #imm` form is read: past 127 GCC loads the bound from
    the constant pool instead, and then there is no count here to find.
    The guard is not always adjacent -- here twelve instructions of the
    function's epilogue sit between the branch and the `mova` -- so the
    window is generous, and a count picked up from the wrong compare is
    caught by the entry scan below, which still takes the lower of the
