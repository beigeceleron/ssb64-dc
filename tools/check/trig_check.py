"""The port's __sinf and __cosf against libultra's, three ways.

The port's gusinf.c and gucosf.c are ssb-decomp-re/src/libultra/gu's
sinf.c and cosf.c as tools/export/ssb_trigexport.py writes them at build
time, with one change that matters: each constant is written `{hi, lo}`
through a union that overlays a double, and that only reads correctly on
a big-endian machine. Compiled as written on the SH-4, the
leading coefficient comes out as -3.4e-17 instead of -0.1666666 and
sin(x) quietly becomes x -- which for the small angles most of the game
uses looks entirely plausible. So the swap is checked rather than
trusted, and so is everything around it:

  constants  the doubles the port's tables produce are the ones the ROM
             carries. smashbrothers.us.yaml puts these two functions'
             .rodata at 0x03FD60 and 0x03FF20; both hold the same eight
             doubles -- five polynomial coefficients, 1/PI, and PI split
             in two -- and the check reads them out of the baserom and
             compares. Nothing here trusts the hex in the source.

  text       every other line of the output is the decomp's line. The
             only differences allowed are the constant lines, whose
             expected form the check derives from the ROM itself, the two
             `#pragma weak` lines the port drops (the exporter says why),
             and comments and __libm_qnan_f the exporter adds.

  run        both functions swept against the C library's over float bit
             patterns, reporting how far apart they are. Not a
             correctness test -- libultra's polynomial is not required to
             be correctly rounded, and its answer is the one the port
             wants whatever glibc says -- but it is what catches the
             collapse above, and it is the number that says what the
             libultra swap changed. --exhaustive sweeps all 2^32 arguments, which for
             a float is a complete answer rather than a sample.

Usage: python3 tools/check/trig_check.py [--rom <rom.z64>] [--exhaustive]
                                   [--stride N]
