"""ssb64-dc: the items' own models, baked out of ITCommonObject.

Every item's `ITAttributes.data` points at a `DObjDesc` array in
ITCommonObject (relocData 0x56), and `itManagerMakeItem` walks it --
`gcSetupCustomDObjsWithMObj` on the common arm, `itManagerSetupItemDObjs`
on the `is_item_dobjs` one -- handing each entry's own `dl` to
`gcAddDObjForGObj`. Those are N64 display lists, and the port draws
nothing from one: `gcSubmitDObj` (src/dc/objdisplay.c) submits `dobj->dv`,
the BAKED model, and `gcDrawDObjForGObj` skips a DObj whose `dv` is NULL.
So an item built that way has the right attributes, the right collision
and no picture at all.

This bakes the tree instead. It is `bake_map_object`'s own recipe
(tools/export/ssb_stageexport.py:967) over a much smaller tree -- every one of
the 34 is 2 to 4 joints, which is why the whole set fits in one run.

TWO OF THE THIRTY-FOUR DRAW THROUGH A DL-HEAD ARRAY. Heart's and Sword's
`dl` is not a display list: it is `{ s32 list_id; Gfx *dl }` pairs
terminated by list_id == 4, which gcDrawDObjDLLinks queues into
gSYTaskmanDLHeads[list_id]. Read as commands it disassembles to
gsDPNoOpTag and gsDPNoOp and bakes to nothing -- which is how both came
out empty for a step. `dobj_dl_links` is the test, and it needs both
halves: a list may open with a zero word (G_NOOP is 0x00000000), so a
small list_id alone is ambiguous, and the walk to the terminator is what
settles it.

EVERY DObjDesc ENTRY THAT NAMES AN MObjSub GETS AN MObj. On the N64
`gcSetupCustomDObjs` allocates one per entry, and a dozen ported files
write through `dobj->mobj`: four of them (`itgshell.c`, `itrshell.c`,
`itbombhei.c`, `itnbumper.c`) unconditionally, which with no MObj is a
store past address zero. Twelve of the 34 tables carry `p_mobjsubs` --
Star, FFlower, BombHei, GShell, RShell, MBall, Tosakinto, Lizardon,
Spear, Starmie, GBumper, NBumper -- and this file once packed
none of them, because the rule was `animated` (does the table carry a
MatAnimJoint), which is about whether a SCRIPT moves the materials and
says nothing about whether the item's own code reads them.

EACH MObj CARRIES ONE FRAME, the picture its own batch already baked --
except Star and Fire Flower, the only two of the 34 whose
table carries a MatAnimJoint script (item_models's own docstring). Both
scripts step `palette_id` alone, never `texture_id_curr` (measured, not
assumed -- the file header comment here used to say Fire Flower's flame
stepped a sprite array and it does not). `pack_item` bakes those two
through the SAME dynamic-palette-bank mechanism of
tools/export/ssb_effectexport.py: one CI4 picture, one PVR bank, the raw N-frame
TLUT data riding in the pack for src/dc/objmodel.c to rewrite at runtime
whenever `palette_id`'s frame changes. Green/Red Shell's own `palette_id`
difference is NOT a script (their table carries none) -- it is a constant
their own it/itgshell.c-derived code sets, unrelated to this file.

WHAT IS NOT HERE IS ANIMATION. An item's `AnimJoint`/`MatAnimJoint`
scripts are read out of region 1 of the item pack by `itGetPData`, at the
offsets the decomp names, and the port's own interpreter plays them; they
are not part of this pack and would be wrong in it -- they address joints
by the game's index, and this pack's joints are the same tree but its own
numbering. The one exception is a FIGHTER item (FIGHTER_ITEMS below), whose
scripts are in a fighter's file the item pack does not carry: those travel
in the model pack as an animation block, one entry per pack joint, the way
an effect pack's do.

THE MONSTER WEAPONS COME OUT OF THE SAME FILE. ITCommonData also carries
twelve `WeaponAttributes` tables, and seven of them are the Poké Ball
monsters' own weapons -- a DObjDesc tree in ITCommonObject like an item's,
reached through the weapon's table rather than through an item's. `--weapons`
bakes those, to `wp<name>.mdl`, and reports the five that do not with a
reason (KNOWN_UNBAKED); four of the five are the ITEMS' weapons, which
have been firing invisibly since their items landed.

#
# ITCommonObject's other 48 blocks are the model vocabulary; ONE of them is
# a bare display list rather than a DObjDesc tree, and it is not an item's:
# it is the Container smash debris. itBoxContainerSmashMakeEffect (which
# BOTH itbox.c and ittaru.c reach) reads it as
# `attr->data - BoxDataStart + BoxEffectDisplayList` and hands the same
# `Gfx*` to ITCONTAINER_EFFECT_COUNT hand-made DObjs, each with its own
# random scale and spin, then runs a custom process over them.
#
# The port draws nothing from a DL, so it bakes -- as a ONE-JOINT model,
# which is the same graft shape bake_map_object uses for a map object with
# no DObjDesc of its own (tools/export/ssb_stageexport.py:967). The port's side
# then gives each debris DObj that joint's payload through
# dc_model_hidden_payload, which is the accessor src/dc/objmodel.h already
# has for a DObj made outside dc_model_add_dobjs.
# The STAGE items: the trees that are in the stage's own
# model file rather than in ITCommonObject. PowerBlock's `data` is
# StageInishieFile3's DObjDesc at 0x11F8 (relocData/260_GRInishieMap.c
# names it in that table's own initializer), and the port's item pack
