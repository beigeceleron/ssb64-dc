"""ssb64-dc: the game's camera-animation scripts, out of relocData and into
a bank the port loads (src/dc/camanim.c).

A CamAnimJoint is one AObjEvent32 script -- the same 32-bit animation
language sys/objanim.c's gcParseDObjAnimJoint reads for a DObj -- but
registered on a CObj instead, where gcParseCObjCamAnimJoint drives ten
camera tracks (nGCAnimTrackEyeX..nGCAnimTrackFovY, objdef.h:248-259)
rather than a joint's transform. The scene says which parser a script
belongs to; nothing in the script itself does.

The game reaches one the way it reaches everything else in a relocData
file: `lbRelocGetFileData(AObjEvent32*, sFiles[n], &ll<Name>CamAnimJoint)`
-- the loaded file's base plus a linker offset. The port has no such
address space, so this tool cuts each named script out of its file and
writes it to a bank the scene loads by name.

    python3 tools/export/ssb_camanimexport.py --bank OpeningRoom \\
        --out romdisk/mvopeningroom.cam [--rom <rom.z64>]
    python3 tools/export/ssb_camanimexport.py --bank OpeningRoom --list

WHY A COPY IS NOT ENOUGH, AND WHAT THIS TOOL DOES ABOUT IT.

An AnimJoint script's Jump/SetAnim/SetInterp opcodes are followed by a
POINTER word, and in the ROM that word is an absolute N64 address the
file's intern reloc chain patched into place. Lift the words out by
memcpy alone and those pointers still name the file they came from: the
parser follows one into whatever now lives there, never finds an End,
and spins. That does not crash -- it hangs a frame loop, which presents
as a black screen (src/dc/stage.c:230-257 carries the same note for the
stage packs' map AnimJoints, and it is why they are written the way they
are).

So the bank is emitted the way a stage's map anims and a fighter pack's
AnimJoint animations already are: the script's words verbatim, plus a
relocation list naming which of them hold a pointer. Each listed word
carries its target's WORD INDEX in the bank, and camanim_bank_load turns
it into an address once the bank is in RAM. A pointer whose target is
outside the script is a hard refusal here rather than a silent hang
there.

None of the thirteen scripts this tool ships today has a pointer word at
all (all thirteen are linear: no Jump, no SetAnim, no SetInterp), so the
list comes out empty for every one of them -- but it is the walk that
establishes that, not an assumption, and ssb_assets.animjoint_walk
refuses an unrelocated pointer rather than stepping over it.
