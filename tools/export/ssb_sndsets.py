"""ssb64-dc: which samples each scene needs in sound RAM, and whether it fits.

On the N64 the whole sound-effect bank (B1_sounds2) and the whole music
bank (B1_sounds1) are resident for the life of the cartridge. The
Dreamcast has 2 MB of sound RAM for both, and the VS game alone reaches
about 1.97 MB of sound effects and 0.89 MB of music as AICA ADPCM -- so
src/dc/sndres.c keeps only what the running scene can reach, and this is
where "can reach" is decided.

A sound set is a group of samples, both kinds:

  menu        the menu scenes' FGMs (title through stage select, the
              unlock message and the results screen's announcer and
              crowd) and the music those scenes' port files name
  core        every FGM a VS battle can play whoever is fighting: the
              common moveset, items and Pokemon, projectiles, effects,
              the HUD and announcer, and all nine stages -- plus the
              battle's own non-stage music (Star, Hammer, the Mushroom
              Kingdom hurry)
  results     the results screen's music: every win fanfare and Results
  fighter:K   one fighter's own FGMs: ft/ftchar/ft<k>/ and its
              relocData Main/MainMotion files, whose motion scripts and
              FTAttributes voices name them
  stage:G     one stage's own music track

and src/dc/sndres.c composes a scene's need out of them at runtime,
because only then is it known who is fighting where.

What counts as reachable is measured, not listed. An FGM id is reachable
from a group when a decomp source file in that group names it
(nSYAudioFGM*/nSYAudioVoice*, code and relocData alike); its samples are
the voice script's articulations, fork closure included, and each
articulation's trigger args (tools/export/ssb_fgmexport.py's walkers). A music
track's waves are the ones its notes actually select: the sequence is
walked with the port's own channel rules (src/dc/seq/seqcore.c: every channel
starts on the bank's first valid program, channel 9 on the percussion
instrument, program changes skip empty slots) and its own sound lookup
(bgmbank.c bgm_bank_lookup_sound's binary search, which with overlapping
key ranges does not pick what a scan would), and each track's loop body
is replayed until the set stops growing, since a program change inside a
loop body applies to the notes before it on the next pass.

  --check       rebuild everything from the decomp and the ROM, print the
                per-scene budget table, and fail if any tier-A id is
                unaccounted for or any scene's worst case exceeds the
                budget (./run.sh test sndsets)
  --out FILE    also write sndsets.bin for the target

sndsets.bin, all little-endian:
  char magic[8] "SSBSETS1"
  u32  n_groups, budget_bytes
  n_groups x { u32 off; u16 n_fgm; u16 n_bgm }
  per group at off: u16 fgm_bank_index[n_fgm], u16 bgm_wave_index[n_bgm]
Group order is fixed and src/dc/sndres.h names it: menu, core, results,
fighter 0..11 in nFTKind order, stage 0..8 in nGRKind order.
