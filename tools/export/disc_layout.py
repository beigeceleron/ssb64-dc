"""disc_layout.py -- where each file goes on the GD-ROM.

mkisofs writes files in the order it walks the tree, which is alphabetical:
`aeroplane.tra` first and `zelda.mdl` last. That is the worst order there
is, because it interleaves every scene's files with every other scene's.
`-sort <file>` overrides it -- one `<path> <weight>` line per file, highest
weight nearest the start of the data track -- and this is what writes that
file.

The order is the layout table, in code, so the plan and
the image cannot drift apart without one of them failing: a file in the
tree that MANIFEST does not name is an error here, and tools/check/disc_check.py
reads the finished ISO back and asserts the extents really ascend in this
order.

What it is and is not for, from the same plan: the whole game is ~50 MB,
about 7% of a CD, so every file is within a narrow radial span of every
other and seek *time* is near the drive's minimum whatever we do. The
order is not a seek-avoidance trick. It is here so that each scene's read
is one ascending run -- the drive streams forward instead of stepping back
and forth over the same few millimetres -- and so that a scene's files
sit together for the read-ahead. The levers that decide a load screen are
still how many bytes a scene reads (the `io:` log) and when it
reads them (file lifetimes).

Where the run sits is the pad's job (PAD below). The GD-ROM drive spins a
CD at constant angular velocity, so the outer edge passes the laser about
twice as fast as the inner edge, where an unpadded image puts every
byte. A zero-filled file of the right size, first on the track, pushes
the whole game out to the end of an 80-minute disc.
